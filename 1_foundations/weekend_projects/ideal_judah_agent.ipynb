    "# Project Idea: Ideal Judah Agent\n",
    "## Business Requirements & Goals\n",
    "- Build an AI agent that acts as the ideal version of yourself (Judah), providing guidance, motivation, and actionable plans.\n",
    "- The agent should accept your personal goals, routines, and preferences, and use them to generate daily/weekly plans, reminders, and suggestions.\n",
    "- When asked, the agent should retrieve and summarize your goals, routines, and progress.\n",
    "- If you feel down or need motivation, the agent should suggest personalized visualizations, affirmations, and uplifting content.\n",
    "- Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant information from your personal notes, documents, or curated knowledge base to provide context-aware advice and answers.\n",
    "- The agent should be able to answer questions about your goals, suggest improvements, and adapt its responses based on your feedback and emotional state.\n",
    "- Provide a simple interface (chat, dashboard, or voice) for easy interaction.\n",
    "- Ensure privacy and security of your personal data.\n",
    "## Example Use Cases\n",
    "- \"What are my goals for this week?\"\n",
    "- \"Remind me of my morning routine.\"\n",
    "- \"I'm feeling low, can you help?\" (Agent responds with affirmations, visualizations, and motivational content)\n",
    "- \"How am I progressing towards my fitness goal?\" (Agent uses RAG to pull from your logs/notes)\n",
    "- \"Suggest improvements to my daily schedule.\"\n",
    "## RAG Opportunities\n",
    "- Use RAG to fetch and summarize your personal notes, past journal entries, or curated articles for context-aware responses.\n",
    "- Enhance affirmations and visualizations by retrieving relevant content from a knowledge base or external sources.\n",
    "- Provide tailored advice by combining your data with best practices and expert recommendations."
